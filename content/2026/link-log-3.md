Thank you to [korrok](https://korrok.tech/webring) for adding me to your webring. Check it out to find some more cool sites!

[Lifewasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhIGCLgo0V4) is a short film by artist Vewn. The film centers around a lolcow and a documentarian filming his life. Most beautiful piece of art I've seen this year. 

An essay naming [Putin's fascism](https://libertiesjournal.com/online-articles/eternal-fascism-contemporary-russia-in-fourteen-characteristics/) through the lens of [Umberto Eco](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/). 

[Duion](http://duion.com), as he's known online, has been around for a while. I met him in Diggy's MUC before it got nuked. Check it out. (Disclaimer: no HTTPS)

[Cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/) helps download songs and videos found on common social media sites. I'm more of a yt-dlp guy myself, but it's good to have backups. 

Need some [filters for your ad blocker](https://filterlists.com/)? 

[Catbox](https://catbox.moe) is a cute file uploader. If you use Discord and want to share a longer video but don't have Nitro, you can upload it here, get a link, and then it'll automatically embed when you send it in Discord. Thanks Catbox, very cool!

[Quad9](https://quad9.net) is a nonprofit DNS resolver run out of Switzerland. It's extremely easy to set up and makes you instantly more private on the internet.
