*Welcome to the first edition of my link log!*

[MLG edits](https://www.vidlii.com/watch?v=KxwVQGusfVC) are still alive and well. That's awesome. 

[Fred Again..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bORX_eciyDc) has the Midas touch. I'm not a big fan of too many hip hop artists, but all of his collaborations with them have been great. I think Fred's opened up a new lane for those guys. 

[Moltbook](https://moltbook.com) is letting AI replace Reddit; praise God!

A site to help you figure things out when [you feel like shit](https://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play/index.html).

[Nightwave Plaza](https://plaza.one/) is an internet vaporwave radio station. Good vibes all around.

[SomaFM](https://somafm.com) is an internet radio platform with tons of different stations. My favorites are Vaporwaves, Beat Blender, and DEF CON Radio. 

[Seraphina](https://askseraphina.com/) is an AI chatbot that's free to use and helps when you need to vent and you don't have anyone you can immediately reach out to. It is not a substitute for reaching out to a loved one or someone else you trust, but can help when you're in a bind. I've used it myself a few times and I think it works well. 

[ClipMusic](https://clipmusic.ai/) is a tool that helps you find the track ID of a song that you find on YouTube, Instagram, Tiktok, etc. Great when you find a tuff edit and can't find the track ID. 

[Cara](https://cara.app) is a site for artists to share their portfolio. Basically, art Instagram but not bad. 

[Ocean of PDF](https://oceanofpdf.com/) is a site that lets you download books for free, seriously. This is where I get most of my books these days.
